Comparison operators in Python are used to compare two values. They result in either True or False based on the comparison.

Here are the common comparison operators in Python along with examples:




Equal to (==): Checks if the values of two operands are equal.

5 == 5  # True
'hello' == 'world'  # False



Not equal to (!=): Checks if the values of two operands are not equal.

5 != 5  # False
5 != 10  # True




Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

10 > 5  # True
5 > 10  # False




Less than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

5 < 10  # True
10 < 5  # False



Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

10 >= 10  # True
5 >= 10   # False




Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

5 <= 10  # True
10 <= 5  # False



Let's go through some examples combining these operators:

x = 10
y = 5

print(x == y)   # False
print(x != y)   # True
print(x > y)    # True
print(x < y)    # False
print(x >= y)   # True
print(x <= y)   # False
