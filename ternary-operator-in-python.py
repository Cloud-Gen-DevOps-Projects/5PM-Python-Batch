In Python, the ternary operator allows you to write conditional expressions in a concise way. The syntax of the Python ternary operator is:



x if condition else y

Here's how it works:

condition: This is the expression that evaluates to True or False.
x: This is the value to be returned if the condition evaluates to True.
y: This is the value to be returned if the condition evaluates to False.


Example:


# Regular if-else statement
a = 5
if a > 10:
    b = "Greater than 10"
else:
    b = "Not greater than 10"
print(b)  # Output: Not greater than 10

# Using ternary operator
a = 5
b = "Greater than 10" if a > 10 else "Not greater than 10"
print(b)  # Output: Not greater than 10


Explanation:

In the example, b = "Greater than 10" if a > 10 else "Not greater than 10" is a ternary operator expression.
If a > 10 evaluates to True, then "Greater than 10" is assigned to b.
If a > 10 evaluates to False, then "Not greater than 10" is assigned to b.

Notes:

The ternary operator in Python is useful for writing compact code for simple conditional assignments.
It enhances readability when the condition and the resulting values are simple and straightforward.
However, complex expressions might reduce readability and are better handled with regular if-else statements.
